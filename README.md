Simple REST API for tiny URLs - toy project to help people to learn the go programming language

This tutorial permits to learn go in an easy way, in creating a simple project: a REST API for tiny URLs.

This project has the following goals:

1. Create a REST API to create and request tiny URLs, stored in a dedicated database, that respects [standard Go project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
2. Store each tiny URL in a dedicated database (like PostgreSQL).
3. Use Docker to run localy the service.
4. Use Heroku to host the service "in the clouuuud" (eg. a remote server).
